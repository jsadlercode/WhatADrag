# Composables Refactoring Summary

This document outlines the composables that were created to simplify and organize the drag-and-drop task management code.

## Created Composables

### 1. `useTaskManagement.ts`
**Purpose**: Manages task state and operations including positioning logic.

**Exported Functions**:
- `updateTask(updatedTask: Task, targetTask?: Task)` - Updates task status and position
- `addTask(task: Omit<Task, 'id'>)` - Adds a new task
- `removeTask(taskId: number)` - Removes a task and adjusts positions

**Exported Computed Properties**:
- `todoTasks` - Filtered and sorted todo tasks
- `doingTasks` - Filtered and sorted doing tasks  
- `doneTasks` - Filtered and sorted done tasks

**Usage**: Used in `App.vue` to manage the main task state and operations.

### 2. `useDragAndDrop.ts`
**Purpose**: Handles all drag and drop state management and event handlers.

**Exported Reactive State**:
- `draggedTask` - Currently dragged task
- `draggedOverTask` - Task being dragged over
- `draggedOverColumn` - Column being dragged over

**Exported Functions**:
- `handleDragStart(task: Task)` - Initiates drag operation
- `handleDragEnd()` - Cleans up after drag operation
- `handleTaskDragOver(task: Task)` - Handles dragging over tasks
- `handleTaskDragLeave()` - Handles leaving task drag zones
- `handleColumnDragOver(event: DragEvent, status: string)` - Handles column drag over
- `handleColumnDragLeave(event: DragEvent)` - Handles leaving column drag zones
- `handleDrop(event: DragEvent, status: string, onUpdateTask: Function)` - Handles drop operations

**Usage**: Used in `FlexBoard.vue` to manage drag and drop interactions.

### 3. `useTaskDragEvents.ts`
**Purpose**: Handles individual task card drag events with proper emit integration.

**Exported Functions**:
- `handleDragStart(event: DragEvent)` - Handles task drag start with dataTransfer
- `handleDragEnd()` - Handles task drag end
- `handleDragOver(event: DragEvent)` - Handles dragging over task
- `handleDragLeave(event: DragEvent)` - Handles leaving task with boundary detection

**Usage**: Used in `TaskCard.vue` to handle drag events for individual task cards.

## Benefits of Refactoring

### 1. **Separation of Concerns**
- Business logic separated from UI components
- Drag and drop logic isolated from task management
- Event handling abstracted into reusable functions

### 2. **Reusability**
- Composables can be reused across different components
- Drag and drop logic can be applied to other draggable elements
- Task management logic can be extended for other task operations

### 3. **Testability**
- Each composable can be unit tested independently
- Business logic is decoupled from Vue components
- Easier to mock dependencies for testing

### 4. **Maintainability**
- Cleaner, more focused component code
- Complex logic is organized in dedicated files
- TypeScript provides better type safety across modules

### 5. **Code Organization**
- Related functionality grouped together
- Easier to locate and modify specific features
- Better code structure following Vue 3 composition API patterns

## File Changes Made

### `App.vue`
- Removed complex task positioning logic
- Now uses `useTaskManagement` composable
- Simplified to focus on UI state and component orchestration

### `FlexBoard.vue`  
- Removed drag and drop state management
- Now uses `useDragAndDrop` composable
- Cleaner component focused on layout and event delegation

### `TaskCard.vue`
- Removed individual drag event handlers
- Now uses `useTaskDragEvents` composable
- Simplified to focus on task card presentation

### `GridBoard.vue`
- Fixed TypeScript errors by removing unused TaskCard import
- Ready for future implementation using the same composables

## Type Safety

All composables are fully typed with TypeScript, providing:
- Better development experience with IntelliSense
- Compile-time error detection
- Clear contracts between composables and components
- Shared `Task` interface across all modules

This refactoring significantly improves the codebase's organization, maintainability, and reusability while maintaining all existing functionality.
